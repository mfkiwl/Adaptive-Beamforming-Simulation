this is a working simulation of an Adaptive Beamforming Radar using MATLAB Simulator which employs Machine Learning Algorithms and proves that the Least Mean Squared approach (LMS) is the best option for a simple antenna.

The provided MATLAB code simulates a beamforming scenario with an antenna array and evaluates two beamforming algorithms: Least Mean Squares (LMS) and Constant Modulus (CM). Here's a description of the code's functionality:

1. Initialization and Parameters:
   - Various parameters are initialized at the beginning of the code. These include the number of antennas (`NumofAntenna`), the number of bits to be transmitted (`NumofSamples`), system noise variance (`SigmaSystem`), and angles of signal and noise sources in radians (`theta_x`, `theta_n1`, and `theta_n2`).

2. Time Settings:
   - The code sets up time-related parameters, including a timeline (`t`) and simulation frequency based on a bit rate (`BitRate`) and sample period (`Ts`).

3. Generating Complex MSK Data:
   - Random binary data is generated and converted into a complex Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal (`signal_x`) with a specific phase.

4. Generating Noise:
   - Two interferer noise sources (`signal_n1` and `signal_n2`) are generated. These have Gaussian amplitude distribution and uniform phase distribution within the range (-π, π).

5. Generating System Noises:
   - System noises for each antenna are generated with uniform phase distribution within the range (-π, π) and Gaussian amplitude distribution. These noises are stored in the `noise` array.

6. Array Responses:
   - Array responses for the desired signal (`response_x`) and the two interferer noise sources (`response_n1` and `response_n2`) are calculated based on the antenna array geometry.

7. Total Received Signal:
   - The received signals from the desired source, interferer noises, and system noises are calculated for each antenna and stored in arrays (`x`, `n1`, `n2`).

8. Beamforming:
   - The code allows the user to select between two beamforming algorithms: LMS or CM. 
   - For LMS, the algorithm adapts the antenna weights to minimize the error between the desired signal and the received signal.
   - For CM, the algorithm normalizes the amplitude of the output to achieve constant modulus. It also adapts the antenna weights.
   
9. Plots:
   - The code generates several plots to visualize the results. These include phase and magnitude comparisons between the desired and received signals, as well as the amplitude response of the antenna array.

10. Error Handling:
    - The code includes error handling for user inputs, such as checking whether parameters like `NumofAntenna`, `NumofSamples`, `SigmaSystem`, `theta_x`, `theta_n1`, and `theta_n2` are within valid ranges. It also ensures that the user selects a valid beamforming method (LMS or CM).

This code is designed to simulate and evaluate the performance of beamforming algorithms in the presence of interference and noise in an antenna array system. It provides valuable insights into how well the antenna array can focus on the desired signal while mitigating interference and noise.
